# Data-Simulation
The project was created with help of R studio and the data files were imported
from an online database, the code was written in the workspace, leading to the project.
The graphs show an interesting data type that and all of them are line graphs and
include data that is much different and seperated. The graphs of the countires all have
similar but different patterns, the pakistan graph, goes up and then goes down whereas
the graph for spain starts at the top and goes down and goes up again. The graph for
Italy follows a different pattern and is uniformly most of the way down.
The data does have a significant change, as the year changes and it can be seen
for different countries and genders, like Spain and Italy have a totally different pattern.
In a period from 2014 to 2021, there is a significant change in the team and can
be seen throughout the time, which offers a new direction to the data making it wider
and hard to comprehend as it changes for each country and the genders.
In the graph, the level of education percentage, different countries have different
dates and change over a period of time. The three countries, Italy, Pakistan, and Spain
are moving differently. The level of education is uniform for Italy, while pakistan tends to
increase and take a downward turn but Spain starts at the very top, has a downward
trend and proceeds to be uniform after.
